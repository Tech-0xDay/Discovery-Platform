## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_socketio'`

**Solution**:
```bash
cd backend
pip install flask-socketio==5.3.6 python-socketio==5.11.0
```

### Frontend Socket.IO Not Connecting

**Check 1**: Is backend running?
```bash
# Should see:
[Socket.IO] Server initialized
```

**Check 2**: Is VITE_API_URL correct?
```bash
# In frontend/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**Check 3**: Browser console logs?
```javascript
// Should see:
[Socket.IO] Connecting to http://localhost:5000
[Socket.IO] Connected successfully
```

### Prefetch Not Working

**Check console**:
```javascript
[Prefetch] Completed in XXXms
```

If you see errors:
1. Backend must be running first
2. Check CORS configuration
3. Check network tab for failed requests

### No Real-Time Updates

**Backend Console**:
```
[Socket.IO] Client connected
[Socket.IO] Emitted project:created
```

**Frontend Console**:
```
[Socket.IO] Connected successfully
[Socket.IO] Project created: {...}
```

If not seeing these:
1. Restart both servers
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check firewall/antivirus
